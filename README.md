# LookOut-for-Pictorial-Explanation

This is my implementation of the **LookOut** algorithm described here https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/lakoglu/pubs/18-pkdd-lookout.pdf .

To see how to use the algorithm, check out the file showcase.py.

A short post detailing the algorithm can be found [here](https://antonfjohansson.github.io/blog_posts/lookout.html)
